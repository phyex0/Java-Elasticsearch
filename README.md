# Java-Elasticsearch
<p>In this project, I tried to run ElasticSearch as the primary database. 

To run the application do the following commands:</p>

<br>1-) Install the docker. </br>
<br>2-) Run the "elasticsearch.yaml" file under the docker directory.</br>
<br>3-) Run the spring boot application.</br>
<br>4-) You can reach the endpoint by swagger from: "localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html"</br>

<p>
<br></br>


  
</p>
<p>I added a sample query to filter by date according to sample User & Order entities.

I also enabled the Virtual thread. This project runs Java 22.

There are some basic crud operations with rest.</p>


<br>To create custom queries => https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/reference/elasticsearch/repositories/elasticsearch-repository-queries.html </br>
