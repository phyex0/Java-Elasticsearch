# Java-Elasticsearch
In this project, I tried to ElasticSearch as the primary database. 

To run the application do the following commands:\n

1-) You should've installed the docker.\n
2-) Run the "elasticsearch.yaml" file under the docker directory.\n
3-) Run the spring boot application.\n
4-) You can reach the endpoint by swagger from: "localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html"\n

I added a sample query to filter by date according to sample User & Order entities.

I also enabled the Virtual thread. This project runs Java 22.

There are some basic crud operations with rest.
